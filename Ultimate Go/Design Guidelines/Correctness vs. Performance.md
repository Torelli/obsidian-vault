Go have enough tooling so we don't have to guess if the code is performative so we should focus on its **correctness** ([[Integrity]], [[Readability]], [[Simplicity]]) instead. ^bd6920

*"If you thinking about performance you're guessing.  And one thing that's great about Go that I want to teach is **do not guess**, we never guess. If you're guessing you're gonna be wrong..."* - William Kennedy

*"Make it correct, make it clear, make it concise, make it fast. In that order."* - Wes Dyer

*"The correctness of the implementation is the most important concern, but there is no royal road. It involves diverse tasks such as thinking of invariants, testing and code reviews. Optimization should be done, but not prematurely"* - Al Aho (Inventor of AWK)
