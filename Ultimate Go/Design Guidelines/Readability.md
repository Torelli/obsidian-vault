 Structure our systems to be more comprehensible:

 - **Subjective aspect:** Everybody on the team should be able to read code
	 - The average developer of the team should have a full mental model of the codebase and even teach that codebase
 - **Objective aspect:** Do not hide the cost of the code (abstraction on top of abstraction that hides how the code really works)
